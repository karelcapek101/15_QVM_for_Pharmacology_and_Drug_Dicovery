# QVM for Pharmacology and Drug Discovery

This repository is part of the **Quansistor Field Computing (QFC) corpus**.

**Canonical entry point:** https://github.com/101researchgroup

## Overview

This whitepaper introduces a **deterministic operator-based molecular computation framework** for pharmacology and drug discovery.

Molecules are treated as **operator systems**, enabling reproducible and interpretable analysis without stochastic simulation.

---

## Core Ideas

- Molecular Hamiltonians as primary objects
- Spectral signatures of binding and stability
- Deterministic ligand-protein interaction analysis
- Elimination of Monte Carlo sampling and heuristic ML
- Regulatory-grade auditability

---

## Key Applications

- Lead candidate ranking
- Binding affinity analysis
- Off-target risk detection
- Structural stability assessment
- Early-stage drug discovery pipelines

---

## Role in the QFC Corpus

This document positions QVM as a **scientific-grade computational apparatus** for pharmacology, aligned with regulatory and reproducibility requirements.
